## My Biography
Hi all, my name is **Jonathan Allen** - I am a fourth-year CIR BA/MA student interested in gaining coding experience. I am the Rock Format Chief for [WHPK](whpk.org), UChicago's student radio station, and have a radio show every Friday at 5 PM.

Learning how to use Markdown and navigating repositories is new for me but feels relatively intuitive (especially writing in md). After mistakenly enrolling into 30121 without the prior boot camp experience, this course seems much more suitable for me.
